In recent years, interoperability has become a burning issue in current consumer-centric Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem where heterogenous devices, protocols and things communicate with each other via locally available gateways. The problem becomes more stringent when consumers depend on the protocol-specific vertical silos that are engaged with the e-healthcare or consumer' wellness care domain in the IoT-based scenario, thus resulting into a vulnerable system to be fail-affected by causing problems for the consumers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel IoT-gateway system that incorporates the heterogeneity perspective to assure the interoperability via utilizing the message queuing broker services to assist in the consumer' wellness service provisioning for the consumers. In this study, we implement a novel interoperable IoT-gateway test-bed that involves 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio signal, IEEE 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth protocols to get seamlessly translated in interchangeable formats. We implemented the IoT-gateway and three IoT-motes physically to establish a proof-of-concept e-health message service while implying real-life pulse sensor, pulse-oximeter (SPO2) sensor and galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors. We also developed two virtual IoT-motes and embedded within the novel IoT-gateway hardware platform to simulate and test the possibility of further indulgent of more protocols to get associated with the proposed IoT-gateway framework. The proposed IoT-gateway is tested against the various quality factors to compare with available gold-standards to meet the quality of service for envisaged consumers. The results have shown the promising direction of futuristic application of smart edge-based IoT-gateway for possible consumer' wellness care supports toward all classes of consumers in the world.
